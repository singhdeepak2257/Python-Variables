#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
a = 5
b = "John"
print(a)
print(b)
#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
#A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
